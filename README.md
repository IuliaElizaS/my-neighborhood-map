 ## My Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Schoolarships and has only learning purpose.

In this project, students have to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood the students choose. Then students have to add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. The application also has to be mobile responsive.


## Specification

For this project there is no starting code. The students have to build the app from scratch according to the project rubric.

## Important

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md);

- The application can be run offline using the service worker that is provided via create-react-app. It will work only on production build (production mode);

- The project includes `google-maps-react` library;

-  The app uses GoogleMaps API, GoogleApiWrapper and Foursquare API;


## How to run the application

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. NOTE: the service worker only works in production mode. To build the app for production run `npm run build` before `npm start`
